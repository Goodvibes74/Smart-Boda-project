# Boda Boda Accident Detection System

A compact, sensor-based system designed to detect boda boda accidents in real time and build a reliable, rider-focused accident database for Kampala’s urban mobility ecosystem.

## Project Overview

Boda bodas play a vital role in Kampala’s transport network but are involved in nearly half of the city’s reported road accidents. Many minor incidents go undocumented, limiting the effectiveness of safety interventions. This project aims to fill that data gap by equipping motorcycles with low-cost, sensor-based devices that capture crash data and transmit it via a mobile application.

## How It Works

- **Crash Detection:** Uses accelerometers, GPS, and other onboard sensors to detect sudden impacts or motion patterns indicative of a crash.
- **Data Capture:** Logs critical data including timestamp, location, speed, and impact force for each incident.
- **Data Transmission:** Transmits data to a central server through a custom-built mobile application, allowing real-time monitoring and management.
- **Dashboard (optional future work):** A data visualization interface for city planners and researchers to view patterns and trends.

## Objectives

- Provide accurate, rider-centered accident data.
- Support data-driven urban safety planning.
- Empower policymakers with actionable insights.
- Give boda boda riders a voice in transportation policy.

## Components

- **Hardware:** Accelerometer, GPS module, microcontroller (e.g., ESP32/Arduino), power supply, and protective casing.
- **Software:**
  - Embedded firmware for sensor data acquisition.
  - Mobile app for data sync and user interface.
  - Backend service for secure data storage and processing.
